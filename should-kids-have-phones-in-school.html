Analytical Exposition: Mobile Phones Should be Banned for Students at School
Nowadays students always bring their mobile phones everywhere and anytime including to school. Somehow, mobile phones are helpful sometimes, but it also can bring bad effects for their studying at school.
Firstly, mobile phones will make students not focus on their studying at school. If students bring their mobile phones, it will be no doubt if they will play their mobile phones at studying time. For example, a student plays a game in his mobile phone while studying time. He is ignoring the teacher and his obligation to study at school.
Secondly, mobile phones will make students dependent. As we know that mobile phones are completed with so many things such as calculator, dictionary, and google. It is afraid if students will depend on their mobile phones, for example a student needs to answer a mathematic question. To make it easy, he uses his calculator in mobile phones. This thing will make him become dependent student because he depends his accounting skill on mobile phones calculator.
Thirdly, mobile phones will make students become unsocial. When students have had their mobile phones on their hands, they will not be able to be distracted including their own friends. They will only focus on their own mobile phones without socializing with friends. Of course, it will bring bad social effect for them.
Mobile phones may be helpful for students somehow, but the bad effects that they bring is many more. Finally, I personally conclude that mobile phones should be banned for students at school </a>

They are allowedto do this by their parents for emergency reasons. From my points of view, bringing mobile phones to schoolcan be accepted, as long as it does not disturb learning activities in the classroom.Students commonly go to school and come home without their parents. In this case, I believe thatmobile phones are essential. If the students get into some trouble on their way, they can phone their parentsimmediately.Moreover, the parents need to inform their children every time they have to get home late from work.I have no doubt that mobile phones are very useful for parents. Parents can easily contact relatives to take careof their children when they have to be late.Nevertheless, what makes mobile phones annoying is the fact that the ringing of the mobile phonessan interrupt the learning process in the classroom. The students will also lose concentration when they theirfriends.In conclusion, my attitude towards this case is that students can bring their mobile phones to school foremergency cases, as long as they turn them off in the class.7.

Title Thesis guments mendation Nowadays we rely heavily on modern technology for communication. Mobile phones are a useful gadgets to have, even for high school students. Unfortunately, many school systems have banned the use of mobile phones from school grounds. Why? My solution to this is that the school board, principals and teachers should make a rule that says mobile phones have to be turned off and kept away during school hours. If a student is caught texting or playing games with their mobile phone in the class, the teacher should take the phone for the rest of the day. The student counselor should invite their parents to school and make an agreement not to let their children text or play games during the learning process. This seems like a reasonable compromise because that way, the students are still able to contact whoever they need to after school, but are free from distractions during the school hours.

                                            Mobile Phones at School Nowadays more and more students bring their mobile phones to school. While I (1) ............... that students should carry mobile phones in case of an emergency, I am (2) ............... to phones being used at school, particularly in the classroom. Firstly, many students travel to and from school without their parents. Therefore, it is important for them to have a mobile phone in case they need help or have an accident on the way to school or home. (3) ................., parents who work may need to contact their children. For example, if a parent has to work late, the student has to be told if arrangements have been made for a relative or neighbour to look after them. (4) ....................., nothing is more disruptive during a lesson than the sound of a mobile phone ringing or playing an annoying tune. Moreover, students who send and receive text messages in class are not paying attention to the lesson. (5) ....................., I feel that students should be allowed to take mobile phones to school for use in an emergency. However, all phones should certainly be turned off during lessons.In conclusionbelievestrongly opposedOn the other handFurthermoreNext​</a>

                                            Title (Tolong bantu cari title nya ya kak)Thesis :Nowadays we rely heavily on modern technology for communication. Mobile phones are a useful gadgets to have, even for high school students. Unfortunately, many school systems have banned the use of mobile phones from school grounds. Why? Arguments (Tolong bantu cari arguments nya ya kak)Recommendation : My solution to this is that the school board, principals and teachers should make a rule that says mobile phones have to be turned off and kept away during school hours. If a student is caught texting or playing games with their mobile phone in the class, the teacher should take the phone for the rest of the day. The student counselor should invite their parents to school and make an agreement not to let their children text or play games during the learning process. This seems like a reasonable compromise because that way, , the students are still able to contact whoever they need to after school, but are free from distractions during the school hours.​​</a>

Analytical Exposition: Mobile Phones Should be Banned for Students at School
Nowadays students always bring their mobile phones everywhere and anytime including to school. Somehow, mobile phones are helpful sometimes, but it also can bring bad effects for their studying at school.
Firstly, mobile phones will make students not focus on their studying at school. If students bring their mobile phones, it will be no doubt if they will play their mobile phones at studying time. For example, a student plays a game in his mobile phone while studying time. He is ignoring the teacher and his obligation to study at school.
Secondly, mobile phones will make students dependent. As we know that mobile phones are completed with so many things such as calculator, dictionary, and google. It is afraid if students will depend on their mobile phones, for example a student needs to answer a mathematic question. To make it easy, he uses his calculator in mobile phones. This thing will make him become dependent student because he depends his accounting skill on mobile phones calculator.
Thirdly, mobile phones will make students become unsocial. When students have had their mobile phones on their hands, they will not be able to be distracted including their own friends. They will only focus on their own mobile phones without socializing with friends. Of course, it will bring bad social effect for them.
Mobile phones may be helpful for students somehow, but the bad effects that they bring is many more. Finally, I personally conclude that mobile phones should be banned for students at school </h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Jawaban:</strong></p><p>Kids should not be given smartphone </p><p></p><p>In this era we know that smartphone is the important thing that could help almost every daily activity for Human life especially for doing learn from home. But if we see, the effect of using smartphone for kids is pretty bad if they can't wisely use it. The effect of using smartphone for kids is would make the kids become addict to the smartphone itself which is that shouldn't be happen at the early age.</p><p></p><p>so thats why kids shouldn't be given smartphone for the long time, maybe its enough to make them just know what is smartphone is then tell them that they are not enough age to use it.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

                            16. Text for Questions number 7-8Mobile phoneCurrently, the number of students who bring mobile phones to school is increasing. They are allowedto do this by their parents for emergency reasons. From my points of view, bringing mobile phones to schoolcan be accepted, as long as it does not disturb learning activities in the classroom.Students commonly go to school and come home without their parents. In this case, I believe thatmobile phones are essential. If the students get into some trouble on their way, they can phone their parentsimmediately.Moreover, the parents need to inform their children every time they have to get home late from work.I have no doubt that mobile phones are very useful for parents. Parents can easily contact relatives to take careof their children when they have to be late.Nevertheless, what makes mobile phones annoying is the fact that the ringing of the mobile phonessan interrupt the learning process in the classroom. The students will also lose concentration when they theirfriends.In conclusion, my attitude towards this case is that students can bring their mobile phones to school foremergency cases, as long as they turn them off in the class.7.

Title Thesis guments mendation Nowadays we rely heavily on modern technology for communication. Mobile phones are a useful gadgets to have, even for high school students. Unfortunately, many school systems have banned the use of mobile phones from school grounds. Why? My solution to this is that the school board, principals and teachers should make a rule that says mobile phones have to be turned off and kept away during school hours. If a student is caught texting or playing games with their mobile phone in the class, the teacher should take the phone for the rest of the day. The student counselor should invite their parents to school and make an agreement not to let their children text or play games during the learning process. This seems like a reasonable compromise because that way, the students are still able to contact whoever they need to after school, but are free from distractions during the school hours.

                        <p>Title: Enhancing Learning Environment: Regulating Mobile Phone Use in Schools</p><p></p><p>Thesis: In today's technology-driven world, mobile phones have become an essential communication tool. However, despite their usefulness, many schools have implemented bans on mobile phone usage within their premises. This text proposes a solution wherein the school board, principals, and teachers collaborate to enforce a rule that requires students to turn off and store their mobile phones during school hours. Furthermore, if students are found using their phones for texting or playing games during class, teachers should confiscate the devices for the remainder of the day. Additionally, student counselors should involve parents in this process by organizing meetings to establish an agreement that discourages mobile phone usage during the learning process. This approach strikes a reasonable compromise, enabling students to stay connected after school while minimizing distractions during school hours.</p><p></p><p>Chapter 9: It Would be Better If (Title)</p><p><strong>Jawaban:</strong></p><p>Title: "Effective Regulation of Mobile Phone Usage in Schools: Minimizing Distractions and Maximizing Learning"</p><p></p><p>Thesis Statement: Despite the widespread use of mobile phones and their potential benefits, many schools have banned their usage on school grounds. In order to address this issue, implementing a rule that requires students to turn off and keep their phones away during school hours, with consequences for violations, can strike a balance between allowing communication and minimizing distractions.</p><p></p><p>Arguments:</p><p></p><p>1. Minimizing distractions: Mobile phones can be a significant source of distraction for students during class. Texting and playing games on phones divert their attention away from the learning process, leading to decreased focus, lower academic performance, and disrupted classroom environments. By enforcing the rule to keep phones turned off and away during school hours, students are encouraged to concentrate on their studies without the constant temptation of digital distractions.</p><p></p><p>2. Encouraging responsibility: Taking appropriate measures regarding mobile phone usage helps foster a sense of responsibility in students. By holding students accountable for their actions and implementing consequences for violations, such as temporarily confiscating phones, it reinforces the importance of adhering to school rules and prioritizing their education over personal technology usage.</p><p></p><p>3. Effective communication channels: While mobile phones are useful tools for communication, allowing unrestricted usage during school hours can lead to misuse and disruption. By setting clear boundaries and establishing designated times for phone usage, such as breaks or after school, students can still maintain communication with their parents or guardians without compromising the learning environment.</p><p></p><p>4. Parental involvement and support: Involving parents in the process is crucial for reinforcing the importance of adhering to the established rules. By inviting parents to school and discussing the agreement regarding mobile phone usage, parents can understand the rationale behind the policy and actively support its implementation at home. This collaborative effort between the school and parents strengthens the message and promotes consistency in expectations.</p><p></p><p>Recommendation:</p><p></p><p>To strike a balance between the benefits and drawbacks of mobile phone usage in schools, it is recommended that the school board, principals, and teachers enforce a policy requiring students to turn off and keep their phones away during school hours. This policy should be accompanied by consequences for violations and involving parents in the process to ensure cooperation and support. By implementing these measures, students can focus on their studies, minimize distractions, and still have access to their phones during appropriate times for communication.</p><br />

                            32. Title (Tolong bantu cari title nya ya kak)Thesis :Nowadays we rely heavily on modern technology for communication. Mobile phones are a useful gadgets to have, even for high school students. Unfortunately, many school systems have banned the use of mobile phones from school grounds. Why? Arguments (Tolong bantu cari arguments nya ya kak)Recommendation : My solution to this is that the school board, principals and teachers should make a rule that says mobile phones have to be turned off and kept away during school hours. If a student is caught texting or playing games with their mobile phone in the class, the teacher should take the phone for the rest of the day. The student counselor should invite their parents to school and make an agreement not to let their children text or play games during the learning process. This seems like a reasonable compromise because that way, , the students are still able to contact whoever they need to after school, but are free from distractions during the school hours.​​</h2><br />

                        <p>because the teachers are afraid that the students trying to use their mobile phones for doing bad things that the teacher might not want to see for example trying to cheat in exams,or maybe playing video games on it.</p>because when the student bring the phones to school, they use it very useless. sometimes student use the wrong way, like playing games with friend and the not use to learning<br />
