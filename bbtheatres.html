I had 1 free ticket to watch a movie. I had no idea about the movie I would like to watch and I did not know the schedule of that theatre. So that, I just wanted to come and see if there was any good movie. I parked my motorcycle at the parking area and I walked slowly at the hall of the theatre. I took my ticket on my wallet and go to the information section to ask about how to use it that day. Unfortunately, I missed it. The ticket was already expired 2 days before. I went home and I was very disappointed about that. Questions: 1. What does the text tell about? Answer: 2. Where did the writer go yesterday? Answer: 3. Based on the text, how many theatres are there in the writer's town? Answer: 4. Why did the writer cannot use his ticket in the theatre? Answer: 5. *... go to the information section to ask about how to use it...." What does the underlined wor refer to? Answer:​</a>

                                            1. Identify the part of speech and Determiners of each word in these following sentences. Hospital If you look at the front of a large, modern hospital, you may notice that there are two separate entrances. One of these is for patients in need of immediate treatment - it is the emergency entrance. Here ambulance are to be seen pulling up at any hour of the day or night. The other entrance is the main entrance of the hospital. On the ground floor; inside the main entrance there are probably a reception area and waiting room, and also an office. On the floors above and below are the numerous other departments. On a lower floor may be the laundry and the kitchen. On another floor will be a maternity section for mothers and their babies. Their hospital, so that babies do not catch other people's illnesses. The rooms for other patients are usually on the higher floors. There are small room for just one patient slightly larger room for two, three or four patients, and larger rooms called wards, in which as many as 40 or 50 patient may lie in-rows of beds. On other floors are the operating rooms, called operating theatres, and special departments such as the radiography department, where x-rays are taken and developed. In the laboratories, special tests are carried out on body tissues and fluids to find out the nature of a patient's disease. The pharmacy supplies the drug to treat patients. Near to the-operating theatres is the blood bank to store blood for transfusions. Here too is the sterilizing department, where all the operating theatres and in the wards are cleaned and made free from germs. A very large staff is needed to run a hospital efficiently It consist of people who work together in teams. The hospital administrators organize the day-to-day working of the hospital. The medical staff, including the doctors and nurses, work directly with the patients. So too do such people as the physiotherapists, anesthetists and radiographers Grouped together, these people are sometimes known as paramedical workers'.​</a>

Usually we have to decide carefully how we spend our income. when we exercise our choise, we do so according to our personal scale of preferences. In this scale of preferences essential commodities come first (food, clothing, shelter, medical expenses etc.), then the kind of luxuries which help us to be comfortable (telephone, spesial furniture, insurance etc.), and finally those non essentials which give us personal pleasure (holidays, parties, visit to theatres or concert, chocolates, etc). They may all seem important, but their true importance can be measured by deciding which we are prepared to live without. Our decisions indicate our scale of preferences and therefore our priorities.my translate is:Orang sangat jarang memiliki segala sesuatu yang mereka inginkan. Biasanya kita harus memutuskan dengan cermat bagaimana kita menghabiskan penghasilan kita. Ketika kita menjalankan pilihan kita, kita melakukannya menurut ukuran pribadi kita. Dalam skala preferensi komoditas penting datang pertama (makanan, pakaian, tempat tinggal, biaya medis DLL.), kemudian jenis kemewahan yang membantu kita menjadi nyaman (telepon, furnitur, asuransi DSB.), dan akhirnya orang-orang non penting yang memberi kita kesenangan pribadi (liburan, pesta, mengunjungi bioskop atau konser, coklat, DLL). Mereka semua mungkin tampak penting, tetapi kepentingan mereka yang sebenarnya dapat diukur dengan memutuskan di mana kita siap untuk hidup tanpanya. Keputusan kita menunjukkan skala pilihan kita dan karena itu prioritas kita.mohon dikoreksi ​</a>

                                            Remedial Answer the questions based on the following text! Hi, I am Andrea. Last Saturday I went to the theatre. It was the only theatre at my town. I had 1 free ticket to watch a movie. I had no idea about the movie I would like to watch and I did not know the schedule of that theatre. So that, I just wanted to come and see if there was any good movie. I parked my motorcycle at the parking area and I walked slowly at the hall of the theatre. I took my ticket on my wallet and go to the information section to ask about how to use it that day. Unfortunately, I missed it. The ticket was already expired 2 days before. I went home and I was very disappointed about that. Questions: 1. What does the text tell about?, Answer: 2. Where did the writer go yesterday? Answer: 3. Based on the text, how many theatres are there in the writer's town? Answer: 4. Why did the writer cannot use his ticket in the theatre? Answer: 5. "... go to the information section to ask about how to use it...." What does the underlined word refer to? Answer:jawaban pake bahasa Inggris bukan di terjemahkan ​</a>

Meanwhile in the city, Taki Tachibana lives a busy life as a high school student while juggling his part-time job and hopes for a future in architecture. One day, Mitsuha awakens in a room that is not her own and suddenly finds herself living the dream life in Tokyo—but in Taki’s body! Elsewhere, Taki finds himself living Mitsuha’s life in the humble countryside. In pursuit of an answer to this strange phenomenon, they begin to search for one another. Kimi no Na wa. revolves around Mitsuha and Taki’s actions, which begin to have a dramatic impact on each other’s lives, weaving them into a fabric held together by fate and circumstance.My Review: Your Name became the number 1 movie in Japan ever last year and in my opinion it deserves it. This film is at face value about a girl and boy switching places, but it becomes so much more than that. It becomes about them finding each other and working together through the connection they have formed over time. It is exciting, heartbreaking, funny, fun, and beautiful all at the same time. It’s art is top notch and the story is great. I can’t really explain much more without giving away a lot of the plot, so I will just say that you should go watch it when it comes out. It’s not in Ames but it is in Des Moines, but seriously it is SOOOOOOOO good. Please go watch.​</a>

Tourism is travel for recreational, leisure, or business purposes, The World
Tourism Organization defines tourists as people "travelingto and staying in places outside their usual environment for not more than one consecutive year for leisure.
Tourism has become a popular global leisure activity. After slowly recovering from the contraction resulting from the late-2000s recession, where tourism suffered a strong slowdown from
the second half of 2008 through the end of 2009. Tourism is important, and in some cases, vital for many countries. It was recognized in the Manila Declaration on World Tourism as "an activity essential to the life of nations because of its direct effects on the social, cultural, educational, and economic sectors of national societies and on their international relations." Tourism brings in large amounts of income in payment for goods and services available, accounting for 30% of the world's exports of services, and 6% of overall exports of goods and services. It also creates opportunities for employment in the service sector of the economy, associated with tourism.If you need to exchange your dollars into Rupiah, please use a bank or money exchange.

I had no idea about the movie I would like to watch and I did not know the schedule of that theatre. So that, I just wanted to come and see if there was any good movie. I parked my motorcycle at the parking area and I walked slowly at the hall of the theatre. I took my ticket on my wallet and go to the information section to ask about how to use it that day. Unfortunately, I missed it. The ticket was already expired 2 days before. I went home and I was very disappointed about that. Questions: 1. What does the text tell about?2. Where did the writer go yesterday?3. Based on the text, how many theatres are there in the writer's town? 4. Why did the writer cannot use his ticket in the theatre? 5.

Hospital If you look at the front of a large, modern hospital, you may notice that there are two separate entrances. One of these is for patients in need of immediate treatment - it is the emergency entrance. Here ambulance are to be seen pulling up at any hour of the day or night. The other entrance is the main entrance of the hospital. On the ground floor; inside the main entrance there are probably a reception area and waiting room, and also an office. On the floors above and below are the numerous other departments. On a lower floor may be the laundry and the kitchen. On another floor will be a maternity section for mothers and their babies. Their hospital, so that babies do not catch other people's illnesses. The rooms for other patients are usually on the higher floors. There are small room for just one patient slightly larger room for two, three or four patients, and larger rooms called wards, in which as many as 40 or 50 patient may lie in-rows of beds. On other floors are the operating rooms, called operating theatres, and special departments such as the radiography department, where x-rays are taken and developed. In the laboratories, special tests are carried out on body tissues and fluids to find out the nature of a patient's disease. The pharmacy supplies the drug to treat patients. Near to the-operating theatres is the blood bank to store blood for transfusions. Here too is the sterilizing department, where all the operating theatres and in the wards are cleaned and made free from germs. A very large staff is needed to run a hospital efficiently It consist of people who work together in teams. The hospital administrators organize the day-to-day working of the hospital. The medical staff, including the doctors and nurses, work directly with the patients. So too do such people as the physiotherapists, anesthetists and radiographers Grouped together, these people are sometimes known as paramedical workers'.​</h2><br />

                            23. Translate the following passage into good indonesian.People very seldom have everything they want. Usually we have to decide carefully how we spend our income. when we exercise our choise, we do so according to our personal scale of preferences. In this scale of preferences essential commodities come first (food, clothing, shelter, medical expenses etc.), then the kind of luxuries which help us to be comfortable (telephone, spesial furniture, insurance etc.), and finally those non essentials which give us personal pleasure (holidays, parties, visit to theatres or concert, chocolates, etc). They may all seem important, but their true importance can be measured by deciding which we are prepared to live without. Our decisions indicate our scale of preferences and therefore our priorities.my translate is:Orang sangat jarang memiliki segala sesuatu yang mereka inginkan. Biasanya kita harus memutuskan dengan cermat bagaimana kita menghabiskan penghasilan kita. Ketika kita menjalankan pilihan kita, kita melakukannya menurut ukuran pribadi kita. Dalam skala preferensi komoditas penting datang pertama (makanan, pakaian, tempat tinggal, biaya medis DLL.), kemudian jenis kemewahan yang membantu kita menjadi nyaman (telepon, furnitur, asuransi DSB.), dan akhirnya orang-orang non penting yang memberi kita kesenangan pribadi (liburan, pesta, mengunjungi bioskop atau konser, coklat, DLL). Mereka semua mungkin tampak penting, tetapi kepentingan mereka yang sebenarnya dapat diukur dengan memutuskan di mana kita siap untuk hidup tanpanya. Keputusan kita menunjukkan skala pilihan kita dan karena itu prioritas kita.mohon dikoreksi ​</h2><br />

I had 1 free ticket to watch a movie. I had no idea about the movie I would like to watch and I did not know the schedule of that theatre. So that, I just wanted to come and see if there was any good movie. I parked my motorcycle at the parking area and I walked slowly at the hall of the theatre. I took my ticket on my wallet and go to the information section to ask about how to use it that day. Unfortunately, I missed it. The ticket was already expired 2 days before. I went home and I was very disappointed about that. Questions: 1. What does the text tell about?, Answer: 2. Where did the writer go yesterday? Answer: 3. Based on the text, how many theatres are there in the writer's town? Answer: 4. Why did the writer cannot use his ticket in the theatre? Answer: 5.

Meanwhile in the city, Taki Tachibana lives a busy life as a high school student while juggling his part-time job and hopes for a future in architecture. One day, Mitsuha awakens in a room that is not her own and suddenly finds herself living the dream life in Tokyo—but in Taki’s body! Elsewhere, Taki finds himself living Mitsuha’s life in the humble countryside. In pursuit of an answer to this strange phenomenon, they begin to search for one another. Kimi no Na wa. revolves around Mitsuha and Taki’s actions, which begin to have a dramatic impact on each other’s lives, weaving them into a fabric held together by fate and circumstance.My Review: Your Name became the number 1 movie in Japan ever last year and in my opinion it deserves it. This film is at face value about a girl and boy switching places, but it becomes so much more than that. It becomes about them finding each other and working together through the connection they have formed over time. It is exciting, heartbreaking, funny, fun, and beautiful all at the same time.

Tourism is travel for recreational, leisure, or business purposes, The World
Tourism Organization defines tourists as people "travelingto and staying in places outside their usual environment for not more than one consecutive year for leisure.
Tourism has become a popular global leisure activity. After slowly recovering from the contraction resulting from the late-2000s recession, where tourism suffered a strong slowdown from
the second half of 2008 through the end of 2009. Tourism is important, and in some cases, vital for many countries. It was recognized in the Manila Declaration on World Tourism as "an activity essential to the life of nations because of its direct effects on the social, cultural, educational, and economic sectors of national societies and on their international relations." Tourism brings in large amounts of income in payment for goods and services available, accounting for 30% of the world's exports of services, and 6% of overall exports of goods and services. It also creates opportunities for employment in the service sector of the economy, associated with tourism.If you need to exchange your dollars into Rupiah, please use a bank or money exchange.

I had no idea about the movie I would like to watch and I did not know the schedule of that theatre. So that, I just wanted to come and see if there was any good movie. I parked my motorcycle at the parking area and I walked slowly at the hall of the theatre. I took my ticket on my wallet and go to the information section to ask about how to use it that day. Unfortunately, I missed it. The ticket was already expired 2 days before. I went home and I was very disappointed about that. Questions: 1. What does the text tell about?2. Where did the writer go yesterday?3. Based on the text, how many theatres are there in the writer's town? 4. Why did the writer cannot use his ticket in the theatre? 5.
