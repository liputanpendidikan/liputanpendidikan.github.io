                                            BANTU JAWAB LH KAK PLISS..in 1969, the NASA launched apollo 11 to the moon. The crews of the mission were Neil Armstrong, Edwin "Buzz" aldrin and michael allen collins. The mission objective for apollo 11 was Simply to take humansto the moon and retrun safely. Both NASA and the crew recognized the mission's significance for all humans, and reflected this in several ways. Apollo 11's mission patch is the only mission patch in NASA history to have no individual names on it. A plaque mounted on one leg of the lunar module, the part of the apollo spacecraft that landed on the moon, bears a map of the earth, the signatures of president Richard Nixon and all three astronauts, and the inscription, "here men from the planet  earth first set foot upon the moon july 1969 A.D. We came in peace for all mankind."   Apollo11 launched from cape canaveral, florida, on july 16, 1969, and arrived in orbit around the moon on july 20. On the 14th orbit of the moon, following eight hours of preparation for the landing, the lunar module eagle undocked from the command module Columbia and descended toward the mare tranquillitatis (sea of tranquilily). Armstrong began actively piloting the eagle when the craft was about 1500 m (about 5000 ft) above the moon and 6 km (4 mil) east of the landing target, maneuvering to avoid boulders in the landing zone. The eagle touched down on the moon's surface very gently about three hours after separating from the Columbia. Armstrong and aldrin prepared the eagle for immediate liftoff in case of emergency, ate a meal, skipped a planned rest period, and began getting ready to go out onto the lunar surface.   At 10:56 PM eastern daylight time neil armstrong became the first human being to set foot on the moon, pronouncing one of the most famous quotes of the 20th century: "that's one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind". Aldrin emerged less than 15 minutes later.Armstrong and aldrin worked on the lunar surface operation's within a radius of about 50 m (160 ft) of the lunar module for about 2 hours and 30 minutes. Their  work included the collection of 22 kg(48 lbs) of rock samples and core tube samples  and setting up a solar wind experiment, a seismometer to detect moonquakes, and a laser reflector. The laser reflector refleced pulses of laser light fired from the earth. This allowed scientists to make very accurate measurement of the distance between the earth and moon. Eagle lifted off to rejoin columbia after just 21 hours and 30 minutes on lunar surface.  The apollo 11 crew retruned to earth on july 24, spalshing down in the pacific ocean about 1.300 km (about 810 mil) southeast of hawaii. The crew spent a lengthy period in biological quaratine to ensure they had not brought any contaminants back to earth, and then spent many months in technical debriefings at NASA and public appearances around the world.Answer the questions below!1. Who were the crew af apollo 11?2. What was the mission objective?3. What was written on a plaque?4. When and where did the apollo 11 launch?5. How long did the eagle take to land on the surface of the moon?</a>

                                            Zebras are four-legged herbivorous mammal who belong to the Equidae Family (horse family). They have a distinctive black and white stripes skin pattern that became their identity within the Equidae family. There are three species of them in the world, they are: the plains zebra, the mountain zebra and the grevy’s zebra. They are originated from Africa.The appearance of a zebra is similar to a horse, the difference is their skin patterns. The black and white stripes on their skin help them to protect themselves from the predator. It allows them to disrupt the focus of the predator when they are moving in a group. The stripes may look the same for human’s eye, but it is actually unique just like human fingerprint and it is different from one zebra to the other.Female zebra is ready for mating when they are three years old, while the male will be ready for that when they are five years old. The color of a baby zebra is brown and white, as they grow older it turns into black and white stripes. A full grown zebra can reach the size of 2,6 m long. The body height can reach 1,3 m and the body weight can reach 350 kg. They can run at the maximum speed of 56 km/h and their kick is strong enough to injure the enemy.jawab soal soal berikut !1.

The Grand Canvon curs steeply through an arid plateau region that lies berween about 1525 and 2.745 m (5.000 and 9000 ft) above sea level . This region, although lacking year round streams in recent years, is sharply ended, showing such characteristic forms as buttes, it is interspersed with old lava tlows, bills composed of volcanie debris and intrusions of igneous rock. The plateau area has a general downward slope to the south west and in its upper reaches is sparsely covered with such evergreens as juniper and pinon Parts of the valley consist principally of such desert plants as agaves and Spanish bayonet. In general the entire canyon area has little soil . The climate of the plateau region above the canyon is severe, with extremes of hoth heat and cold The canyon floor also becomes extremely hot in summer, sometimes reaching 46 C(115*5), but seldom experiences frost in the summer. The Grand Canyon has been sculpted in general by the downward cutting of the Colorado River, which flows the canven's lowest portions Other factors have also played a part. The Kaibab Plateau, which forms the northern rim of the canyon, is abour 365 m (1.200 ft) higher than the Coconino Plateau, which forms the southern rim. Water from the northern side has flowed into the canvon, forming tributary vallevs while the streams of the southern plateau flow away in a southerly direction without carving valleys in the canvon walls The underlving rock beds also have a south western sant, with the result that groundwater from the north finds its way into the canvon, but water from the south does not in the entire canyon region, the rocks have been by jointing and faulting and fractures in the rocks resulting from these processes have contributed to the rapid erosion of the gorge. 1. what is the purpose of the text above?2. where is the location of the grand Canyon? 3. mention types of stone risen from the canyon! 4. what temperature can be reached by the canyon's floor at summer? 5. what is the name of the plateau that from the northern rim of the canyon? terima kasih sebelumnya yang sudah bantu jawab, tolong jangan asal asalan, besok saya harus segera mengumpulkan ini terima kasih​</a>

Opened on June 10, 2009, the 5.4-km bridge is the longest in Indonesia and the first bridge to cross the Madura Strait.The cable-stayed portion has three spans with lengths 192 m, 434 m and 192 m. The bridge has two lanes in each direction plus an emergency lane and a dedicated lane for motorcycles. The first toll bridge in Indonesia, fares have been initially set at Rp. 30,000 (US$3 in 2009) for four-wheeled vehicles and Rp. 3,000 (US$0.30) for two-wheelers.The bridge was built by a consortium of Indonesian companies PT Adhi Karya and PT Waskita Karya working with China Road and Bridge Corp. and China Harbor Engineering Co. Ltd. The total cost of the project, including connecting roads, has been estimated at 4.5 trillion rupiah (US$445 million).Construction was started on August 20, 2003. In July 2004, a girder collapsed, killing one worker and injuring nine others. Work on the bridge halted at the end of 2004 due to lack of funds, but was restarted in November 2005. The main span of the bridge was connected on March 31, 2009, and the bridge was opened to the public in June 10, 2009.Within a week of the opening, it was discovered that nuts and bolts as well as maintenance lamps had been stolen and that there was evidence of vandalism of cables supporting the main span.20.

The Grand Canvon curs steeply through an arid plateau region that lies berween about 1525 and 2.745 m (5.000 and 9000 ft) above sea level . This region, although lacking year round streams in recent years, is sharply ended, showing such characteristic forms as buttes, it is interspersed with old lava tlows, bills composed of volcanie debris and intrusions of igneous rock. The plateau area has a general downward slope to the south west and in its upper reaches is sparsely covered with such evergreens as juniper and pinon Parts of the valley consist principally of such desert plants as agaves and Spanish bayonet. In general the entire canyon area has little soil . The climate of the plateau region above the canyon is severe, with extremes of hoth heat and cold The canyon floor also becomes extremely hot in summer, sometimes reaching 46 C(115*5), but seldom experiences frost in the summer. The Grand Canyon has been sculpted in general by the downward cutting of the Colorado River, which flows the canven's lowest portions Other factors have also played a part. The Kaibab Plateau, which forms the northern rim of the canyon, is abour 365 m (1.200 ft) higher than the Coconino Plateau, which forms the southern rim. Water from the northern side has flowed into the canvon, forming tributary vallevs while the streams of the southern plateau flow away in a southerly direction without carving valleys in the canvon walls The underlving rock beds also have a south western sant, with the result that groundwater from the north finds its way into the canvon, but water from the south does not in the entire canyon region, the rocks have been by jointing and faulting and fractures in the rocks resulting from these processes have contributed to the rapid erosion of the gorge. 1. what is the purpose of the text above? 2. where is the location of the grand Canyon? 3. mention types of stone risen from the canyon! 4. what temperature can be reached by the canyon's floor at summer? 5. what is the name of the plateau that from the northern rim of the canyon?  mohon bantuannya ​</a>

The crews of the mission were Neil Armstrong, Edwin "Buzz" aldrin and michael allen collins. The mission objective for apollo 11 was Simply to take humansto the moon and retrun safely. Both NASA and the crew recognized the mission's significance for all humans, and reflected this in several ways. Apollo 11's mission patch is the only mission patch in NASA history to have no individual names on it. A plaque mounted on one leg of the lunar module, the part of the apollo spacecraft that landed on the moon, bears a map of the earth, the signatures of president Richard Nixon and all three astronauts, and the inscription, "here men from the planet  earth first set foot upon the moon july 1969 A.D. We came in peace for all mankind."   Apollo11 launched from cape canaveral, florida, on july 16, 1969, and arrived in orbit around the moon on july 20. On the 14th orbit of the moon, following eight hours of preparation for the landing, the lunar module eagle undocked from the command module Columbia and descended toward the mare tranquillitatis (sea of tranquilily). Armstrong began actively piloting the eagle when the craft was about 1500 m (about 5000 ft) above the moon and 6 km (4 mil) east of the landing target, maneuvering to avoid boulders in the landing zone. The eagle touched down on the moon's surface very gently about three hours after separating from the Columbia. Armstrong and aldrin prepared the eagle for immediate liftoff in case of emergency, ate a meal, skipped a planned rest period, and began getting ready to go out onto the lunar surface.   At 10:56 PM eastern daylight time neil armstrong became the first human being to set foot on the moon, pronouncing one of the most famous quotes of the 20th century: "that's one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind". Aldrin emerged less than 15 minutes later.Armstrong and aldrin worked on the lunar surface operation's within a radius of about 50 m (160 ft) of the lunar module for about 2 hours and 30 minutes. Their  work included the collection of 22 kg(48 lbs) of rock samples and core tube samples  and setting up a solar wind experiment, a seismometer to detect moonquakes, and a laser reflector. The laser reflector refleced pulses of laser light fired from the earth. This allowed scientists to make very accurate measurement of the distance between the earth and moon. Eagle lifted off to rejoin columbia after just 21 hours and 30 minutes on lunar surface.  The apollo 11 crew retruned to earth on july 24, spalshing down in the pacific ocean about 1.300 km (about 810 mil) southeast of hawaii. The crew spent a lengthy period in biological quaratine to ensure they had not brought any contaminants back to earth, and then spent many months in technical debriefings at NASA and public appearances around the world.1.

                                            2. A motorboat was driving to an island located directly towards the South at a distance I = 4 km. Initially the direction was set on the first navigation mark, next it was set on the second mark and finally the course was set directly towards the island. Thus the route consisted of three straight lines. The speed and the direction of the wind was measured on the boat. The time it took to drive through the first section was t = 3 min, the speed of the wind was measured to be v₁ = 15 m/s and the perceived direction was directly from the East. The second section was driven in time t₂ = 1,5 min, the speed of the wind was v₂ = 10 m/s and the perceived direction was directly from South-East. The third section was driven in time t3 = 1,5 min, the speed of the wind was v3 = 5 m/s and the perceived direction was directly from South-West. What was the actual speed of the wind? Note. At different sections the speed of the boat may have been different but during one section the speed was constant. The time it took to turn and accelerate is negligible. The actual speed and direction of the wind did not change. (A) 10 m/s (B) 12 m/s(C) 14 m/s(D) 18 m/s​</a>

                            4. BANTU JAWAB LH KAK PLISS..in 1969, the NASA launched apollo 11 to the moon. The crews of the mission were Neil Armstrong, Edwin "Buzz" aldrin and michael allen collins. The mission objective for apollo 11 was Simply to take humansto the moon and retrun safely. Both NASA and the crew recognized the mission's significance for all humans, and reflected this in several ways. Apollo 11's mission patch is the only mission patch in NASA history to have no individual names on it. A plaque mounted on one leg of the lunar module, the part of the apollo spacecraft that landed on the moon, bears a map of the earth, the signatures of president Richard Nixon and all three astronauts, and the inscription, "here men from the planet  earth first set foot upon the moon july 1969 A.D. We came in peace for all mankind."   Apollo11 launched from cape canaveral, florida, on july 16, 1969, and arrived in orbit around the moon on july 20. On the 14th orbit of the moon, following eight hours of preparation for the landing, the lunar module eagle undocked from the command module Columbia and descended toward the mare tranquillitatis (sea of tranquilily). Armstrong began actively piloting the eagle when the craft was about 1500 m (about 5000 ft) above the moon and 6 km (4 mil) east of the landing target, maneuvering to avoid boulders in the landing zone. The eagle touched down on the moon's surface very gently about three hours after separating from the Columbia. Armstrong and aldrin prepared the eagle for immediate liftoff in case of emergency, ate a meal, skipped a planned rest period, and began getting ready to go out onto the lunar surface.   At 10:56 PM eastern daylight time neil armstrong became the first human being to set foot on the moon, pronouncing one of the most famous quotes of the 20th century: "that's one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind". Aldrin emerged less than 15 minutes later.Armstrong and aldrin worked on the lunar surface operation's within a radius of about 50 m (160 ft) of the lunar module for about 2 hours and 30 minutes. Their  work included the collection of 22 kg(48 lbs) of rock samples and core tube samples  and setting up a solar wind experiment, a seismometer to detect moonquakes, and a laser reflector. The laser reflector refleced pulses of laser light fired from the earth. This allowed scientists to make very accurate measurement of the distance between the earth and moon. Eagle lifted off to rejoin columbia after just 21 hours and 30 minutes on lunar surface.  The apollo 11 crew retruned to earth on july 24, spalshing down in the pacific ocean about 1.300 km (about 810 mil) southeast of hawaii. The crew spent a lengthy period in biological quaratine to ensure they had not brought any contaminants back to earth, and then spent many months in technical debriefings at NASA and public appearances around the world.Answer the questions below!1.

                            5. Zebras are four-legged herbivorous mammal who belong to the Equidae Family (horse family). They have a distinctive black and white stripes skin pattern that became their identity within the Equidae family. There are three species of them in the world, they are: the plains zebra, the mountain zebra and the grevy’s zebra. They are originated from Africa.The appearance of a zebra is similar to a horse, the difference is their skin patterns. The black and white stripes on their skin help them to protect themselves from the predator. It allows them to disrupt the focus of the predator when they are moving in a group. The stripes may look the same for human’s eye, but it is actually unique just like human fingerprint and it is different from one zebra to the other.Female zebra is ready for mating when they are three years old, while the male will be ready for that when they are five years old. The color of a baby zebra is brown and white, as they grow older it turns into black and white stripes. A full grown zebra can reach the size of 2,6 m long. The body height can reach 1,3 m and the body weight can reach 350 kg. They can run at the maximum speed of 56 km/h and their kick is strong enough to injure the enemy.jawab soal soal berikut !1.

The Grand Canvon curs steeply through an arid plateau region that lies berween about 1525 and 2.745 m (5.000 and 9000 ft) above sea level . This region, although lacking year round streams in recent years, is sharply ended, showing such characteristic forms as buttes, it is interspersed with old lava tlows, bills composed of volcanie debris and intrusions of igneous rock. The plateau area has a general downward slope to the south west and in its upper reaches is sparsely covered with such evergreens as juniper and pinon Parts of the valley consist principally of such desert plants as agaves and Spanish bayonet. In general the entire canyon area has little soil . The climate of the plateau region above the canyon is severe, with extremes of hoth heat and cold The canyon floor also becomes extremely hot in summer, sometimes reaching 46 C(115*5), but seldom experiences frost in the summer. The Grand Canyon has been sculpted in general by the downward cutting of the Colorado River, which flows the canven's lowest portions Other factors have also played a part. The Kaibab Plateau, which forms the northern rim of the canyon, is abour 365 m (1.200 ft) higher than the Coconino Plateau, which forms the southern rim. Water from the northern side has flowed into the canvon, forming tributary vallevs while the streams of the southern plateau flow away in a southerly direction without carving valleys in the canvon walls The underlving rock beds also have a south western sant, with the result that groundwater from the north finds its way into the canvon, but water from the south does not in the entire canyon region, the rocks have been by jointing and faulting and fractures in the rocks resulting from these processes have contributed to the rapid erosion of the gorge. 1. what is the purpose of the text above?2. where is the location of the grand Canyon? 3. mention types of stone risen from the canyon! 4. what temperature can be reached by the canyon's floor at summer? 5. what is the name of the plateau that from the northern rim of the canyon? terima kasih sebelumnya yang sudah bantu jawab, tolong jangan asal asalan, besok saya harus segera mengumpulkan ini terima kasih​</h2><br />

Opened on June 10, 2009, the 5.4-km bridge is the longest in Indonesia and the first bridge to cross the Madura Strait.The cable-stayed portion has three spans with lengths 192 m, 434 m and 192 m. The bridge has two lanes in each direction plus an emergency lane and a dedicated lane for motorcycles. The first toll bridge in Indonesia, fares have been initially set at Rp. 30,000 (US$3 in 2009) for four-wheeled vehicles and Rp. 3,000 (US$0.30) for two-wheelers.The bridge was built by a consortium of Indonesian companies PT Adhi Karya and PT Waskita Karya working with China Road and Bridge Corp. and China Harbor Engineering Co. Ltd. The total cost of the project, including connecting roads, has been estimated at 4.5 trillion rupiah (US$445 million).Construction was started on August 20, 2003. In July 2004, a girder collapsed, killing one worker and injuring nine others. Work on the bridge halted at the end of 2004 due to lack of funds, but was restarted in November 2005. The main span of the bridge was connected on March 31, 2009, and the bridge was opened to the public in June 10, 2009.Within a week of the opening, it was discovered that nuts and bolts as well as maintenance lamps had been stolen and that there was evidence of vandalism of cables supporting the main span.20.

The Grand Canvon curs steeply through an arid plateau region that lies berween about 1525 and 2.745 m (5.000 and 9000 ft) above sea level . This region, although lacking year round streams in recent years, is sharply ended, showing such characteristic forms as buttes, it is interspersed with old lava tlows, bills composed of volcanie debris and intrusions of igneous rock. The plateau area has a general downward slope to the south west and in its upper reaches is sparsely covered with such evergreens as juniper and pinon Parts of the valley consist principally of such desert plants as agaves and Spanish bayonet. In general the entire canyon area has little soil . The climate of the plateau region above the canyon is severe, with extremes of hoth heat and cold The canyon floor also becomes extremely hot in summer, sometimes reaching 46 C(115*5), but seldom experiences frost in the summer. The Grand Canyon has been sculpted in general by the downward cutting of the Colorado River, which flows the canven's lowest portions Other factors have also played a part. The Kaibab Plateau, which forms the northern rim of the canyon, is abour 365 m (1.200 ft) higher than the Coconino Plateau, which forms the southern rim. Water from the northern side has flowed into the canvon, forming tributary vallevs while the streams of the southern plateau flow away in a southerly direction without carving valleys in the canvon walls The underlving rock beds also have a south western sant, with the result that groundwater from the north finds its way into the canvon, but water from the south does not in the entire canyon region, the rocks have been by jointing and faulting and fractures in the rocks resulting from these processes have contributed to the rapid erosion of the gorge. 1. what is the purpose of the text above? 2. where is the location of the grand Canyon? 3. mention types of stone risen from the canyon! 4. what temperature can be reached by the canyon's floor at summer? 5. what is the name of the plateau that from the northern rim of the canyon?  mohon bantuannya ​</h2><br />

                            30. TOLONG DI ARTIKAN KEDALAM B. INDOSIA YA KAK PLISS..in 1969, the NASA launched apollo 11 to the moon. The crews of the mission were Neil Armstrong, Edwin "Buzz" aldrin and michael allen collins. The mission objective for apollo 11 was Simply to take humansto the moon and retrun safely. Both NASA and the crew recognized the mission's significance for all humans, and reflected this in several ways. Apollo 11's mission patch is the only mission patch in NASA history to have no individual names on it. A plaque mounted on one leg of the lunar module, the part of the apollo spacecraft that landed on the moon, bears a map of the earth, the signatures of president Richard Nixon and all three astronauts, and the inscription, "here men from the planet  earth first set foot upon the moon july 1969 A.D. We came in peace for all mankind."   Apollo11 launched from cape canaveral, florida, on july 16, 1969, and arrived in orbit around the moon on july 20. On the 14th orbit of the moon, following eight hours of preparation for the landing, the lunar module eagle undocked from the command module Columbia and descended toward the mare tranquillitatis (sea of tranquilily). Armstrong began actively piloting the eagle when the craft was about 1500 m (about 5000 ft) above the moon and 6 km (4 mil) east of the landing target, maneuvering to avoid boulders in the landing zone. The eagle touched down on the moon's surface very gently about three hours after separating from the Columbia. Armstrong and aldrin prepared the eagle for immediate liftoff in case of emergency, ate a meal, skipped a planned rest period, and began getting ready to go out onto the lunar surface.   At 10:56 PM eastern daylight time neil armstrong became the first human being to set foot on the moon, pronouncing one of the most famous quotes of the 20th century: "that's one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind". Aldrin emerged less than 15 minutes later.Armstrong and aldrin worked on the lunar surface operation's within a radius of about 50 m (160 ft) of the lunar module for about 2 hours and 30 minutes. Their  work included the collection of 22 kg(48 lbs) of rock samples and core tube samples  and setting up a solar wind experiment, a seismometer to detect moonquakes, and a laser reflector. The laser reflector refleced pulses of laser light fired from the earth. This allowed scientists to make very accurate measurement of the distance between the earth and moon. Eagle lifted off to rejoin columbia after just 21 hours and 30 minutes on lunar surface.  The apollo 11 crew retruned to earth on july 24, spalshing down in the pacific ocean about 1.300 km (about 810 mil) southeast of hawaii. The crew spent a lengthy period in biological quaratine to ensure they had not brought any contaminants back to earth, and then spent many months in technical debriefings at NASA and public appearances around the world.1.

                        Inggris<br /><br />Pada tahun 1969, NASA meluncurkan apollo 11 ke bulan. Awak misi tersebut adalah Neil Armstrong, Edwin "Buzz" aldrin dan michael allen collins. Tujuan misi untuk apollo 11 adalah Cukup untuk membawa manusia ke bulan dan mundur lagi dengan selamat. Baik NASA maupun awak kapal menyadari pentingnya misi bagi semua manusia, dan mencerminkan hal ini dalam beberapa cara. Patch misi Apollo 11 adalah satu-satunya patch misi dalam sejarah NASA yang tidak memiliki nama individual di dalamnya. Sebuah plakat terpasang di satu kaki modul bulan, bagian dari pesawat ruang angkasa apollo yang mendarat di bulan, membawa peta bumi, tanda tangan presiden Richard Nixon dan ketiga astronot, dan prasasti tersebut, "di sini orang-orang dari planet bumi pertama menginjakkan kaki di atas bulan juli 1969 AD Kami datang dengan damai untuk seluruh umat manusia. "<br /><br />Apollo11 ​​diluncurkan dari cape canaveral, florida, pada tanggal 16 Juli 1969, dan tiba di orbit mengelilingi bulan pada tanggal 20 Juli. Pada orbit ke-14 bulan, setelah delapan jam persiapan untuk mendarat, modul rajawali lunar dilepaskan dari perintah modul Columbia dan turun ke arah kuda betina tranquillitatis (lautan yang tenang). Armstrong mulai secara aktif mengendarai elang saat pesawat itu berukuran sekitar 1500 m (sekitar 5000 kaki) di atas bulan dan 6 km (4 mil) di sebelah timur target pendaratan, bermanuver untuk menghindari batu-batu besar di zona pendaratan. Elang itu menyentuh permukaan bulan dengan sangat lembut sekitar tiga jam setelah memisahkan diri dari Columbia. Armstrong dan aldrin menyiapkan elang untuk segera lepas landas jika keadaan darurat, makan, melewatkan waktu istirahat yang direncanakan, dan mulai bersiap untuk pergi ke permukaan bulan.<br /><br />Pada pukul 10:56 siang waktu matahari timur neil armstrong menjadi manusia pertama yang menginjakkan kaki di bulan, mengucapkan salah satu kutipan paling terkenal abad ke-20: "Itu adalah satu langkah kecil bagi seorang pria, satu lompatan raksasa bagi umat manusia". Aldrin muncul kurang dari 15 menit kemudian.<br /><br />Armstrong dan aldrin mengerjakan operasi permukaan lunar dengan radius sekitar 50 m (160 kaki) dari modul bulan selama sekitar 2 jam dan 30 menit. Pekerjaan mereka mencakup pengumpulan 22 kg (48 lbs) sampel batuan dan sampel tabung inti dan menyiapkan percobaan angin matahari, seismometer untuk mendeteksi bulan, dan sebuah reflektor laser. Sinar laser reflektor yang dipantulkan sinar laser dipecat dari bumi. Hal ini memungkinkan para ilmuwan membuat pengukuran jarak antara bumi dan bulan dengan sangat akurat. Eagle diangkat untuk bergabung kembali dengan columbia setelah hanya 21 jam dan 30 menit di permukaan bulan.<br /><br /><br />

                            31. 2. A motorboat was driving to an island located directly towards the South at a distance I = 4 km. Initially the direction was set on the first navigation mark, next it was set on the second mark and finally the course was set directly towards the island. Thus the route consisted of three straight lines. The speed and the direction of the wind was measured on the boat. The time it took to drive through the first section was t = 3 min, the speed of the wind was measured to be v₁ = 15 m/s and the perceived direction was directly from the East. The second section was driven in time t₂ = 1,5 min, the speed of the wind was v₂ = 10 m/s and the perceived direction was directly from South-East. The third section was driven in time t3 = 1,5 min, the speed of the wind was v3 = 5 m/s and the perceived direction was directly from South-West. What was the actual speed of the wind? Note. At different sections the speed of the boat may have been different but during one section the speed was constant. The time it took to turn and accelerate is negligible. The actual speed and direction of the wind did not change. (A) 10 m/s (B) 12 m/s(C) 14 m/s(D) 18 m/s​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Jawaban:</strong></p><p>To solve this problem, we can use vector addition to analyze the motion of the motorboat and the effect of the wind. Let's break down the problem step by step.</p><p></p><p>1. First, let's analyze the first section of the boat's journey. The boat is traveling in a straight line, and the wind is blowing directly from the east. We can represent the boat's velocity vector as v₁b (velocity of the boat in section 1) and the wind's velocity vector as v₁w (velocity of the wind in section 1).</p><p></p><p>2. In the second section, the boat is traveling towards the southeast, and the wind is blowing from the east. We can represent the boat's velocity vector as v₂b and the wind's velocity vector as v₂w.</p><p></p><p>3. In the third section, the boat is traveling directly towards the south, and the wind is blowing from the southwest. We can represent the boat's velocity vector as v₃b and the wind's velocity vector as v₃w.</p><p></p><p>Now, let's calculate the velocity vectors for each section:</p><p></p><p>1. In the first section:</p><p>   - The boat's velocity vector, v₁b, is directly towards the south with a magnitude of 4 km / (3 min) = 4 km/min.</p><p>   - The wind's velocity vector, v₁w, is directly from the east with a magnitude of 15 m/s.</p><p></p><p>2. In the second section:</p><p>   - The boat's velocity vector, v₂b, is towards the southeast, but we don't know its magnitude yet.</p><p>   - The wind's velocity vector, v₂w, is directly from the east with a magnitude of 10 m/s.</p><p></p><p>3. In the third section:</p><p>   - The boat's velocity vector, v₃b, is directly towards the south with a magnitude of 4 km / (1.5 min) = 2.67 km/min.</p><p>   - The wind's velocity vector, v₃w, is directly from the southwest with a magnitude of 5 m/s.</p><p></p><p>Now, let's solve for the magnitude of the boat's velocity vector in the second section (v₂b):</p><p></p><p>To find the magnitude of v₂b, we need to consider the resultant vector of the boat's velocity vector and the wind's velocity vector in the second section. Since the boat's velocity and the wind's velocity vectors are in different directions, we can subtract the wind's velocity vector from the boat's velocity vector to find the resultant velocity vector.</p><p></p><p>v₂b - v₂w = resultant vector</p><p></p><p>The resultant vector represents the actual motion of the boat in the presence of wind. The direction of the resultant vector will be the direction the boat is actually moving in the second section.</p><p></p><p>We can solve for the magnitude of the resultant vector as follows:</p><p></p><p>|v₂b - v₂w| = |resultant vector|</p><p></p><p>We know that |v₂w| = 10 m/s (magnitude of the wind's velocity vector in the second section). Let's assume the magnitude of v₂b is "x" m/s.</p><p></p><p>|v₂b - 10| = |resultant vector|</p><p></p><p>The magnitude of the resultant vector will be equal to the magnitude of the boat's velocity vector in the second section.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, we have:</p><p></p><p>|x - 10| = x</p><p></p><p>Simplifying the equation:</p><p></p><p>x - 10 = x  (Since we are taking the magnitude of the vectors, the sign doesn't matter)</p><p></p><p>x - x = 10</p><p></p><p>0 = 10</p><p></p><p>The equation doesn't hold true, which means our assumption that the boat's velocity vector in the second section is "x" m/s is incorrect. This means the boat's velocity in the second section is zero.</p><p></p><p> In other words, the boat is stationary in the second section.</p><p></p><p>Since the boat is stationary, the wind's velocity in the second section must be equal to the boat's velocity vector in the second section, which is zero.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the magnitude of the wind's velocity vector in the second section (v₂w) is 0 m/s.</p><p></p><p>Now, let's move on to the third section:</p><p></p><p>The boat's velocity vector in the third section, v₃b, is directly towards the south with a magnitude of 2.67 km/min. The wind's velocity vector in the third section, v₃w, is directly from the southwest with a magnitude of 5 m/s.</p><p></p><p>We can see that the boat's velocity vector and the wind's velocity vector in the third section are in opposite directions. Therefore, we can subtract the magnitudes of these vectors to find the magnitude of the resultant vector:</p><p></p><p>|v₃b - v₃w| = |resultant vector|</p><p></p><p>|2.67 - 5| = |resultant vector|</p><p></p><p>2.33 = |resultant vector|</p><p></p><p>The magnitude of the resultant vector will be equal to the magnitude of the wind's velocity vector in the third section.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the magnitude of the wind's velocity vector in the third section (v₃w) is 2.33 m/s.</p><p></p><p>To find the actual speed of the wind, we can take the average of the wind's velocity magnitudes in the three sections:</p><p></p><p>Average wind speed = (v₁w + v₂w + v₃w) / 3</p><p></p><p>Average wind speed = (15 + 0 + 2.33) / 3</p><p></p><p>Average wind speed = 17.33 / 3</p><p></p><p>Average wind speed ≈ 5.78 m/s</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the actual speed of the wind is approximately 5.78 m/s.</p><p></p><p>None of the answer choices provided exactly matches this result, but the closest option is (A) 10 m/s.</p><br />
