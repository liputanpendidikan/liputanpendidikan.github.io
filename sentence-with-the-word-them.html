                                            Kev adjusted his position in the hammock, just enough to look round.
     Beyond the shade cast by the trees, the beach was ablaze with sunlight. The glare from the white sand would have been painful if it hadn't been for his sunglasses. Even with them, the flicking pinpoints of light from the sea stabbed sharply into his retina.
     There was still ice in the bucket, though, and the drinks were cold.
     Along the beach, he could see the girl coming back towards him. The bright orange bikini glowed against her tanned skin. She waved.
     He'd promised her a special experience. She didn't know how special it would be. They would have the time of their lives. A very long time. He waved back.
     Everything was perfect. Now was the moment.
     The device resting on his chest looked like an irregular collection of cylinders, in several different shades of red to purple. The interface unit attached to the side was a crude human intrusion, but necessary. He picked up his PalmPC, linked in to the interface, brought up the programme.
     Took a deep breath and hit go.
     The rush of alien symbols across the screen was as expected - but surely that configuration was wrong? Alarmed, Kev reached a finger to the abort icon….
     DISCONTINUITY
     "That's the loop point."
     Kev adjusted his position in the hammock, just enough to look round.
     Beyond the shade cast by the trees, the beach was ablaze with sunlight. The glare from the white sand would have been painful if it hadn't been for his sunglasses. Even with them, the flicking pinpoints of light from the sea stabbed sharply into his retina.

                            8. Kev adjusted his position in the hammock, just enough to look round.
     Beyond the shade cast by the trees, the beach was ablaze with sunlight. The glare from the white sand would have been painful if it hadn't been for his sunglasses. Even with them, the flicking pinpoints of light from the sea stabbed sharply into his retina.
     There was still ice in the bucket, though, and the drinks were cold.
     Along the beach, he could see the girl coming back towards him. The bright orange bikini glowed against her tanned skin. She waved.
     He'd promised her a special experience. She didn't know how special it would be. They would have the time of their lives. A very long time. He waved back.
     Everything was perfect. Now was the moment.
     The device resting on his chest looked like an irregular collection of cylinders, in several different shades of red to purple. The interface unit attached to the side was a crude human intrusion, but necessary. He picked up his PalmPC, linked in to the interface, brought up the programme.
     Took a deep breath and hit go.
     The rush of alien symbols across the screen was as expected - but surely that configuration was wrong? Alarmed, Kev reached a finger to the abort icon….
     DISCONTINUITY
     "That's the loop point."
     Kev adjusted his position in the hammock, just enough to look round.
     Beyond the shade cast by the trees, the beach was ablaze with sunlight. The glare from the white sand would have been painful if it hadn't been for his sunglasses. Even with them, the flicking pinpoints of light from the sea stabbed sharply into his retina.
1. In addition to the device, what else did Kev bring with him?
2. Where did Kev put his device?

                        1. A bucket, a hammock, and some drinks.<br />2. On his chest.<br />3. To the sunglasses.<br />4. Because of the light that bounces of from the sea.<br />5. To tell an event or to entertain people. (I don't know if this is fictional or not but okay)<br />
